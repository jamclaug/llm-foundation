# Phase 4: Training

Advanced training techniques - LoRA fine-tuning, RLHF, and reward models.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning
- Build reward models for RLHF
- Understand reinforcement learning from human feedback pipeline
- Explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods

## Directory Structure

### `notebooks/`
Interactive exploration (to be created):
- LoRA mechanism visualization
- Reward model training
- RLHF training loop

### `src/`
Implementation files (placeholders):
- `lora_finetuning.py` - LoRA implementation and fine-tuning
- `reward_model.py` - Reward model architecture and training
- `rlhf_training.py` - RLHF pipeline (PPO, reward optimization)

### `tests/`
- Validation scripts for training techniques

## Implementation Notes
- Build on phase2 model architectures
- Focus on understanding parameter-efficient methods
- May reference trl (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) library
