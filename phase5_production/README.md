# Phase 5: Production

Deployment and evaluation - model serving, benchmarking, and advanced features.

## Learning Objectives
- Deploy models for inference (quantization, optimization)
- Implement evaluation benchmarks
- Explore advanced features (KV cache, Flash Attention)
- Understand production considerations

## Directory Structure

### `notebooks/`
Interactive exploration (to be created):
- Model optimization techniques
- Benchmark evaluation
- Performance profiling

### `src/`
Implementation files (placeholders):
- `model_deployment.py` - Model serving, quantization, ONNX export
- `benchmarks.py` - Evaluation on standard benchmarks (MMLU, etc.)
- `advanced_features.py` - KV cache, Flash Attention, speculative decoding

### `tests/`
- Performance and correctness tests

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on practical deployment techniques
- Understand inference optimization trade-offs
- May integrate with deployment frameworks (ONNX, TensorRT)
