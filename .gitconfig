# Local git config for llm-foundation repository
# This overrides global settings for this repo only

[user]
    # Your personal GitHub account for commits
    name = Your Name
    email = your-personal-email@example.com

# Note: Copilot authentication is handled separately through VS Code/GitHub CLI
# and uses whichever GitHub account you're signed into in VS Code.
# 
# To use different accounts:
# 1. Commits/pushes: Uses the [user] settings above (personal account)
# 2. Copilot: Sign into your work account in VS Code's GitHub Copilot extension
#
# To apply this config to the repo, run:
#   git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
#
# Or copy these settings directly:
#   git config --local user.name "Your Name"
#   git config --local user.email "your-personal-email@example.com"
